# AI Content Detector

A React application that uses OpenAI's API to detect whether text was written by a human or generated by AI. The application provides both standard and enhanced analysis modes for accurate text classification.

## Features

- **Dual Analysis Modes**:
  - Standard Analysis: Quick and efficient for basic detection
  - Enhanced Analysis: Advanced detection using a hybrid approach
- **Text Analysis**:
  - Single text analysis
  - Batch processing for multiple texts
  - Real-time progress tracking
- **Detailed Statistics**:
  - Word count and sentence count
  - Average words per sentence
  - Complex word detection
  - Personal pronoun analysis
  - Lexical diversity scoring
  - Readability metrics
- **Validation Scoring**:
  - Confidence levels for each analysis
  - Reliability scoring based on multiple factors
  - Text length considerations
  - Pattern recognition validation

## Enhanced Analysis Features

The enhanced analysis mode provides more accurate and reliable results through:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Whitespace normalization
   - URL and email removal
   - Special character handling
   - Punctuation preservation

2. **Hybrid Analysis Approach**:
   - Short texts (< 100 words): Completion-based analysis
   - Longer texts: Combined embedding and completion analysis
   - Weighted scoring system

3. **Advanced Metrics**:
   - Syllable counting
   - Readability scoring
   - Lexical diversity calculation
   - Personal pronoun detection
   - Complex word identification

4. **Improved Prompt Engineering**:
   - Few-shot examples
   - Contextual analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Multiple factor consideration

5. **Batch Processing**:
   - Parallel text analysis
   - Rate limiting
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
4. Enter your OpenAI API key and start analyzing text

## API Key Requirements

- A valid OpenAI API key is required
- The key is used only for detection and is never stored
- Key validation is performed before analysis
- Supports both standard and enhanced analysis modes
